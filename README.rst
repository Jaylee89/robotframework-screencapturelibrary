Robot Framework library for capturing screenshots and image manipulation for the purpose of documentation.

Reason: The motivation for and the end goal of this library is to be able to reproduce the images or screenshots within manual "A User's Guide to Plone 4". By combining Plone's use of Robot Framework and Selenium for testing one should be able to automate both screen captures and various elements or parts of the Plone UI for documentation.


Features I would like to see:

- Output to various image formats including GIMP xcf format so various objects (like arrows, labels, etc. can be easily post-manipulated.
